# GIFdecoder-VB6
Before working on a Gif decoder for PICO-Rasperry in C langage, I began to study the Gif algorithm in Visual Basic 6. I made a source code of GIF pictures decompressor (animated or not) with my old VB6. This example support many types of Gif including animated and transparent (the last known problems are still here).
